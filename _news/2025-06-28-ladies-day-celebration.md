Footscray Rugby Club hosted its annual Ladies Day on June 28, celebrating the incredible women who form the backbone of our rugby family while highlighting pathways into elite rugby in Victoria.

## Honoring Our Rugby Women

The day recognized the vital contributions of every woman who wears our red, white, and blue with pride â€“ from fierce female players to the mums, volunteers, and club legends who make our club what it is today.

## Elite Rugby Pathways

Special guest speakers emphasized the exciting pathways available for women's rugby in Victoria, sharing insights into opportunities for players to progress from club level to elite rugby. Their message was clear: with the right commitment and community support, elite rugby is an achievable reality for dedicated female players.

## A Spirited Match

The celebration coincided with our women's team taking on Endeavour Hills. Despite going down 33-15, the team demonstrated the heart, determination, and skill that embodies the spirit of Ladies Day, showcasing exactly why we celebrate our female players.

*Ladies Day reinforced the strong community bonds that make Footscray Rugby Club a place where women can thrive both on and off the field.*
