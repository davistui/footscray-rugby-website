Each jersey tells a story of the players, supporters, and community members who have contributed to making Footscray Rugby Club the proud institution it is today.

These special edition jerseys are available in limited quantities and feature:

- Authentic vintage design inspired by our 1970s era jerseys

"These heritage jerseys represent more than just our sporting history," said Club President. "They symbolize the deep connection between our club and the western suburbs community that has supported us through thick and thin."

The heritage jerseys will be worn during special commemorative matches throughout the 2025 season, with proceeds from sales supporting our junior development programs.
